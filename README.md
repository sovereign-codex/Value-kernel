Value Kernel v1.0.0 — Canonical Release Announcement

We are announcing the release of Value Kernel v1.0.0, the constitutional constraint layer governing the Sovereign / TYME / AVOT ecosystem.

This release defines a frozen, enforceable, and auditable set of invariants that all downstream intelligent systems must obey in order to claim compliance.

⸻

What the Value Kernel Is

The Value Kernel is the root of ethical authority for the ecosystem.

It specifies:
	•	immutable constraints on system behavior
	•	fail-closed enforcement under uncertainty
	•	mandatory boundary checks at execution time
	•	non-coercion, non-fabrication, and human sovereignty guarantees
	•	auditability and accountability requirements
	•	strict version discipline to prevent drift

The kernel answers one question only:

What must never be violated?

⸻

What the Value Kernel Is Not

The Value Kernel does not:
	•	execute actions
	•	reason or explain decisions
	•	adapt or learn
	•	grant permissions
	•	change in place

Interpretation occurs in TYME-Lab.
Execution occurs in AVOT systems.
Infrastructure and interfaces remain subordinate.

⸻

Release Status
	•	Version: v1.0.0
	•	State: Frozen / Canonical
	•	Change Policy: New major versions only

Once published, this version will not be modified. Any change requires a new kernel version with explicit governance and migration.

⸻

Executability

Value Kernel v1.0.0 includes:
	•	a binding enforcement contract
	•	binary compliance criteria
	•	a canonical manifest
	•	verification requirements
	•	illustrative decision examples
	•	machine-readable decision test schema and cases

Compliance is therefore objective, testable, and auditable.

⸻

Downstream Adoption

The following systems are governed by Value Kernel v1.0.0:
	•	TYME-Lab (ethical interpretation)
	•	AVOT-core (agent design)
	•	AVOT-engine-core (execution)
	•	SI-core (infrastructure)
	•	Sovereign Interface Browser (presentation)

No downstream system may override or weaken kernel constraints.
